        <p>While a network engineer at heart, I am always wanting to push myself into
            new paths and skills within the tech sphere. Here I will list and document them.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            These will include documents and GitHub repositories.

        <p>While I am not the most adventurous person, I do think that everyone should have 
            a place where they can record and look back on some fond moments. This is where that will be.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Here's to the good times.
